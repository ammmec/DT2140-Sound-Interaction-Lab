1. small movements   ->       bubbles
      We imagined a case where there's an app that helps you calm down.
      When holding the phone, if the user is shaking it will do a bubble sound to alert them,
      and it will not be done if they are purposefully moving (bigger movements).

2. 30cm free fall    ->   Sci-Fi
      As a way to warn people around, when a person falls the gesture produces a 
      torpedo sound.

3. Handheld, detect only large movements   ->     wind
      We imagined that the phone is a pretend sword,
      so whenever it is moved in a big way it plays a wind sound because it's "cutting through the wind".
