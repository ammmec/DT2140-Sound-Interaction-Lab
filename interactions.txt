1. small movements   -> bubbles
      We imagined that the phone is a small creature,
      and when it is gendly moved it reacts playfully with a bubble like sound. It does not like big movements.

2. pointing entrance -> engine
      We imagined a cleaning robot that can be instructed to leave.
      When pointing towards the door, it leaves, stopping the engine sound.

3. Handheld, detect only large movements   ->     wind
      We imagined that the phone is a pretend sword,
      so whenever it is moved in a big way it plays a wind sound because it's "cutting through the wind".
